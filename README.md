## Usage
The UI of this project is simple. Upon loading, the user is presented with a text field and a search button. After entering the desired city in the text field, select the "Search" button and the weather will be displayed on the right. There are two sections of information. The top section will display the city's current weather, this includes Name, Date, Conditions, Temperature, Wind Speeds and Humidity. Aside from the city name, the same is displayed below but what is intended over the next five days. 

After searching for a city, the the city is saved as another button below "Search". This can be clicked to display that city's weather again. Localstorage is used to save this information so it can be quickly referenced again when the user returns to the page.
